# CSCI212-Project3

Project 1 implemented via TreeMap to sort the dates. This project also contains a FileMenuHandler to accompany the GUI, not seen in the previous projects, which has two options: "Open" which opens the file to be read and "Quit" which closes the GUI. In addition to this, this project also throws a custom `IllegalArgumentExcpetion` called `IllegalDate212Excpetion` when a date on the list is not in the correct formal e.g too many digits in the date,the month is less than 1 or greater than 12, or the day is less than 1 or greater than 31.

## How the GUI looks like:
